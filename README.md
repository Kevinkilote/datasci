## üß† Project Overview

This project aims to predict house prices in the Greater London area using machine learning models. The dataset lacks typical features like number of bedrooms or property size, making it a challenging and interesting problem for predictive modeling.

### ‚ú® Key Highlights:
- Public transaction-level data from the UK Land Registry
- Feature engineering for time and location data
- Four regression models explored:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - CatBoost
- Best model: **CatBoost**
  - MAE: 0.2900
  - MSE: 0.1842
  - R¬≤: 0.7236
